You can only click on a cell that is adjacent to the one you are already standing on, but not on the previous one you selected. If you make a wrong move, the Labyrinth will take you to another stage of that level. However, this stage is not counted. All levels have 5 stages. Your task is to pass all of them to proceed to the next level. Looks easy. Let's see. Good luck!",
